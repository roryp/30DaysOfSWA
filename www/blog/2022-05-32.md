## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è

1. **An Azure account with an active subscription** - [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio)

2. **The Java Development Kit, version 11 or 8.** - [Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/java/fundamentals/java-support-on-azure)

3. **Apache Maven, version 3.0 or above.** - [Install](https://maven.apache.org/)

4. **Visual Studio Code.** - [Install](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

5. **The Java extension pack** - [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)

6. **The Azure Functions extension for Visual Studio Code** - [Install](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)

## 1. Create function app

In this article, you use command-line tools to create a Java function that responds to HTTP requests. After testing the code locally, you deploy it to the serverless environment of Azure Functions.

Completing this exercise incurs a small cost of a few USD cents or less in your Azure account.

1. In a bash terminal, create and change into a new directory:

    ```bash
    mkdir java-function-resource-group-api && cd java-function-resource-group-api
    ```

1. In a bash terminal, open Visual Studio Code:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. Open the Visual Studio Code command palette: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>p</kbd>.

1. Enter `Azure Functions: create new project`. Use the following table to finish the prompts:

    |Prompt|Value|
    |--|--|
    |**Choose the directory location.**|You should either create a new folder or choose an empty folder for the project workspace. Don't choose a project folder that is already part of a workspace.|
    |**Select a language**| Choose `Java`.|
    |**Select a version of Java**| Choose `Java 11` or `Java 8`, the Java version on which your functions run in Azure. Choose a Java version that you've verified locally. |
    | **Provide a group ID** | Choose `com.function`. |
    | **Provide an artifact ID** | Choose `myFunction`. |
    | **Provide a version** | Choose `1.0-SNAPSHOT`. |
    | **Provide a package name** | Choose `com.function`. |
    | **Provide an app name** | Choose `HttpExample`. |
    | **Select the build tool for Java project** | Choose `Maven`. |
    The project boilerplate is created.

1. Visual Studio Code uses the provided information and generates an Azure Functions project. You can view the local project files in the Explorer.

## 2. Run the function locally

Visual Studio Code integrates with the Azure Functions Core tools to let you run this project on your local development computer before you publish to Azure.

To build and run the application, you would use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean package azure-functions:run
```

Toward the end of the output, the following lines should appear:

 ```bash
 Now listening on: http://0.0.0.0:7071
 Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.

 Http Functions:

         HttpExample: [GET,POST] http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample
 ...
```

1. Copy the URL of your HttpExample function from this output to a browser and append the query string ?name=<YOUR_NAME>, making the full URL like http://localhost:7071/api/HttpExample?name=Functions. The browser should display a message that echoes back your query string value. The terminal in which you started your project also shows log output as you make requests.

1. With the **Terminal** panel focused, press <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> to stop Core Tools and disconnect the debugger.

After you've verified that the function runs correctly on your local computer, it's time to use Visual Studio Code and Maven to publish and test the project on Azure.

## 3. Sign in to Azure

Before you can deploy, sign in to your Azure subscription.

```bash
az login
```

The az login command signs you into your Azure account.

Use the following command to deploy your project to a new function app.

```bash
mvn clean package azure-functions:deploy
```

1. When the creation is complete, the following Azure resources are created in your subscription:

* Resource group. Named as java-functions-group.
* Storage account. Required by Functions. The name is generated randomly based on Storage account name requirements.
* Hosting plan. Serverless hosting for your function app.The name is *java-functions-app-service-plan*.
* Function app. A function app is the deployment and execution unit for your functions. The name is randomly generated based on your artifactId, appended with a randomly generated number.

## 4. Run the function in Azure

1. Back in the **Resources** area in the side bar, expand your subscription, your new function app, and **Functions**. Right-click (Windows) or <kbd>Ctrl -</kbd> click (macOS) the `HttpExample` function and choose **Execute Function Now...**.

    ![Screenshot of executing function in Azure from Visual Studio Code.](../static/img/series/java/32-execute-function-now.png)

2. In **Enter request body** you see the request message body value of `{ "name": "Azure" }`. Press Enter to send this request message to your function.

3. When the function executes in Azure and returns a response, a notification is raised in Visual Studio Code.

## 5. Clean up resources

Use the following command to delete the resource group and all its contained resources to avoid incurring further costs.

```bash
az group delete --name java-functions-group
```
